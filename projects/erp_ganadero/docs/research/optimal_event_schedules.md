## 1. Weight & Growth Events

### Birth Weight
**Event**: Initial weight measurement  
**Timing**: Immediately at birth (within 24 hours)  
**Frequency**: Once  
**Purpose**: Baseline for growth tracking, genetic evaluation  
**Industry Standard**: Critical for all calves

### Regular Weighing
**Event**: Weight measurement  
**Timing by Age**:
- **0-6 months (calves)**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **6-12 months**: Every 4-8 weeks  
- **12+ months**: Every 8 weeks (minimum)
- **Market animals**: Every 2 weeks (final 2 months)

**Purpose**: Monitor average daily gain (ADG), adjust nutrition, detect health issues  
**Industry Standard**: 8-week interval provides <5% error margin  
**Cost-Benefit**: More frequent weighing for young calves yields better growth insights

### Weaning Weight
**Event**: Weight at weaning  
**Timing**: 6-8 months of age  
**Frequency**: Once per calf  
**Purpose**: Performance benchmark, genetic evaluation  
**Target**: 210 kg average

### Sale Weight
**Event**: Final weight before sale  
**Timing**: Day of sale or 1-2 days before  
**Frequency**: Once  
**Purpose**: Accurate pricing, market readiness confirmation

## 2. Health Events

### Vaccination Schedule

#### Calves
**Clostridial Vaccines (7-8 way)**:
- **First dose**: 2-4 months (at branding)
- **Booster**: 2-6 weeks before weaning
- **Annual boosters**: Yearly thereafter

**Respiratory Vaccines (BRD complex)**:
- **First dose**: 2-4 months (at branding)
- **Booster**: 45-60 days later or pre-weaning
- **Purpose**: Prevent IBR, BVD, PI3, BRSV

**Brucellosis (Bangs)**:
- **Timing**: 4-12 months (heifers only)
- **Frequency**: Once (by veterinarian)
- **Legal**: Required in Mexico

#### Adult Cattle (Cows & Bulls)
**Viral Vaccines**:
- **Frequency**: Annually
- **Timing**: Fall (during pregnancy testing) for peak immunity
- **Types**: IBR, BVD, PI3, BRSV

**Bacterial Vaccines**:
- **Vibrio & Lepto**: Annually before breeding
- **Clostridial**: Annual boosters

**Reproductive Disease Vaccines**:
- **Trichomoniasis**: Just before breeding season (short immunity)
- **Frequency**: Annually

**Rabies** (Mexico-specific):
- **Frequency**: Annually
- **Priority**: High in endemic areas (Oaxaca, southern states)
- **Reason**: Vampire bat transmission

### Deworming
**Frequency**: Every 3 months (quarterly)  
**Timing**: Coordinate with other handling events  
**Purpose**: Parasite control, improved feed efficiency

### Treatment Events
**Frequency**: As needed  
**Recording**: Immediate (same day)  
**Data Required**: Diagnosis, medicine, dosage, withdrawal period  
**Purpose**: Health tracking, treatment efficacy, regulatory compliance

## 3. Reproductive Events

### Breeding/Mating
**Recording**: Immediately after breeding  
**Data**: Bull ID, breeding date, method (natural/AI)  
**Purpose**: Calculate expected calving date, track bull performance

### Pregnancy Check
**Timing Options**:
- **Early detection**: 28-32 days (ultrasound or blood test)
- **Standard**: 45-60 days post-breeding
- **Recommended**: 45-60 days after breeding season ends

**Method Comparison**:
| Method | Earliest Detection | Accuracy | Cost |
|--------|-------------------|----------|------|
| Blood (PAG) | 28 days | High | Medium |
| Ultrasound | 28-32 days | Very High | High |
| Palpation | 30-45 days | High | Low |

**Best Practice**: Check 45-60 days after breeding season to:
- Maximize accuracy
- Allow early culling of open cows
- Avoid winter feeding costs for non-pregnant animals

### Birth/Calving
**Recording**: Day of birth  
**Data**: Calf ID, birth weight, gender, complications, dam ID  
**Purpose**: Genetic records, calving interval tracking, mortality analysis

### Weaning
**Timing**: 6-8 months of age  
**Recording**: Day of weaning  
**Data**: Weaning weight, calf condition  
**Purpose**: Performance evaluation, maternal ability assessment

## 4. Financial Events

### Purchase
**Recording**: Day of acquisition  
**Data**: Purchase price, source, initial weight, condition  
**Purpose**: Cost tracking, ROI calculation

### Sale
**Recording**: Day of sale  
**Data**: Sale price, buyer, final weight, price per kg  
**Purpose**: Revenue tracking, performance analysis

### Cost Allocation
**Frequency**: As incurred  
**Types**:
- **Feed costs**: Weekly or monthly
- **Veterinary costs**: Per event
- **Infrastructure**: As purchased
- **Labor**: Monthly

**Purpose**: Accurate cost-per-kg calculation, profitability analysis

### Valuation
**Frequency**: Quarterly  
**Purpose**: Herd value assessment, financial planning  
**Method**: Market price × current weight

---

## 5. Status Change Events

### Status Updates
**Frequency**: As changes occur  
**Types**:
- Active → Rest (temporary removal from breeding)
- Active → Sold
- Active → Dead
- Rest → Active

**Recording**: Same day as change  
**Purpose**: Accurate herd composition, productivity metrics

### Location Changes
**Frequency**: As moved  
**Data**: From location, to location, reason  
**Purpose**: Pasture management, grazing rotation tracking

### Group Assignments
**Frequency**: As needed  
**Purpose**: Management grouping (by age, weight, breeding status)

---

## 6. Mexico-Specific Considerations

### Mandatory Events
1. **Brucellosis vaccination**: 4-12 months (heifers)
2. **Tuberculosis testing**: For certified herds
3. **Screwworm inspection**: Pre-export to US
4. **Tick inspection**: For movement between zones

### Recommended Events
1. **Rabies vaccination**: Annual (endemic areas)
2. **Tick treatment**: Every 3 months
3. **Traceability tagging**: At birth or purchase

## 10. Implementation Recommendations for ERP System

### Auto-Reminders
System should alert users when:
- Vaccination due (based on last vaccination + interval)
- Weighing overdue (based on age + last weighing)
- Pregnancy check recommended (45-60 days post-breeding)
- Deworming due (every 90 days)

### Batch Entry
Allow batch recording for:
- Vaccination of multiple animals
- Weighing sessions
- Group movements

### Mobile Entry
Prioritize mobile-friendly entry for:
- Field weighing
- Birth recordings
- Treatment events

### Data Validation
Enforce:
- Weight must increase over time (flag anomalies)
- Pregnancy check only after breeding
- Vaccination intervals (prevent too-frequent entries)

---

## 11. Cost-Benefit Analysis

### High-Value Events (Best ROI)
1. **Pregnancy checks**: Saves $300-500/year per open cow
2. **Regular weighing**: Optimizes feed costs (10-15% savings)
3. **Vaccination tracking**: Prevents disease outbreaks ($1000s saved)

### Medium-Value Events
1. **Treatment records**: Improves herd health (5-10% productivity gain)
2. **Birth records**: Genetic improvement over time

### Lower-Value Events (But Still Important)
1. **Location tracking**: Pasture management
2. **Group assignments**: Organizational efficiency
